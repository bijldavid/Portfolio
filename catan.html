                                    <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
                                    <p>JavaScript is one of the most commonly used programming languages and plays a
                                        significant role in modern web design. In this case study, I invite you to join
                                        me on my first-ever JavaScript project. This project focuses on experimenting
                                        with JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS. It will showcase my understanding of
                                        various data types, variables, functions, loops, if-statements, and more!
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The task for this project was to create or recreate an existing game using only
                                        JavaScript, HTML, and CSS—simple enough. With my limited prior experience in
                                        JavaScript, I ambitiously chose the board game, Catan. In hindsight, this was
                                        never achievable for a beginner, but it was a fun and insightful project
                                        nonetheless.

                            <h2>THE GAME</h2>
                            <p>“Catan” is a popular strategy board game where players compete to earn victory points,
                                with the first person to reach 10 points declared the winner. In Catan, players gather
                                resources such as wood, brick, grain, ore, and sheep to build roads, settlements, and
                                cities. Settlements and cities earn them victory points. While there is more nuance to
                                the game, this is essentially its core concept. The tricky part of this project was
                                translating the various items and rulesets into an interactive interface.</p>

                    <h2>THE BOARD</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The board in Catan consists of 19 hexagonal tiles, each assigned a resource. Every corner of
                            every tile serves as a potential settlement spot, connected by roads. Consequently, every
                            corner of every tile needed to be clickable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, every space between settlements required a clickable road, resulting in the
                            road-grid. Combine the roads, settlements, and tiles, and you'll have the complete board!
                        </p>

                        <h2>RANDOMIZER</h2>
                        <p>Truth be told, the randomizer wasn't a necessity for the game; instead, it served as a fun
                            challenge to explore JavaScript. That being said, considering that every game of Catan
                            begins with a randomly generated board, there was some value in implementing it.
                        </p>

                        <p>The randomization process involved creating a function that utilized <code>Math.random</code>
                            to shuffle
                            the styles and then reassign them to the tiles.
                        </p>

                        <h2>ROADS AND SETTLES</h2>
                        <p>Creating the road and settlement grid was just the beginning – they had to be interactive
                            too! In a game of Catan, players first choose a settlement spot and then place a road
                            adjacent to it, pointing either upwards, leftwards, or rightwards. This meant the roads had
                            to remain invisible until a player built their settlement. Once settled, only the three
                            adjacent roads should become visible.
                        </p>

                    <h2>PROBLEM SOLVING</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Working on this project made me realize just how much work and effort goes into creating
                            seemingly 'simple' games like Catan. It required a lot of problem-solving and backtracking
                            to create something even remotely functional.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, once something is made invisible, it shouldn't be clickable anymore. Also, when
                            you click something, it should remain active. Randomizing the board should reset all active
                            settlements and roads. The list goes on... In the end, I only managed to create the initial
                            steps of the game.
                        </p>

                        <h2>FINAL PRODUCT</h2>
                        <p>
                            As mentioned above, this represents the extent of what I was capable of creating within the
                            span of this project, barely scratching the surface of the full game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I discovered that JavaScript has a steep learning curve. While this project may not
                            constitute a complete game, I am still very proud of what I have managed to produce. I
                            learned a lot of valuable techniques and am therefore proud to showcase them here!
                        </p>
