                                    <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
                                    <p>Javascript is one of the most written code languages out there and plays a big
                                        part in web design as we know it today. In this case study I bring you along on
                                        my first ever javascript project. This project is all about experimenting with
                                        javascript in conjunction with HTML and CSS. It will highlight my understanding
                                        of the various datatypes, variables, functions, loops, if-statements and more!
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The task for this project was to create or recreate an existing game, utilizing
                                        only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS—simple enough. With my limited prior experience
                                        in JavaScript, I ambitiously selected the board game, Catan. In hindsight, this
                                        was never achievable for a beginner but was a fun and insightful project
                                        nonetheless.

                            <h2>THE GAME</h2>
                            <p>“Catan” is a popular strategy board game where players compete to earn victory points,
                                first person to reach 10 points wins. In Catan, players gather resources: wood, brick,
                                grain, ore, and sheep to build roads, settlements and cities. Settlements and cities
                                earn them victory points. There's some more nuance to it but this is essentially what it
                                boils down to. The tricky part of this project was translating the different items and
                                rulesets into an interactive interface.</p>

                    <h2>THE BOARD</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The board in Catan consists of 19 hexagonal tiles. Every tile has an assigned resource. Every
                            corner of every tile is a potential settlement spot. Settlements are connected by roads.
                            This means that every corner of every tile needed to be clickable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And on top of that, every space between every settlement needed a clickable road. Which
                            resulted in …-grid. Put the roads, settlements and tiles together and you end up with this
                            board!
                        </p>

                        <h2>RANDOMIZER</h2>
                        <p>Truth be told, the randomiser wasn't a necessity for the game; rather, it served as a fun
                            challenge to explore JavaScript. That said, given that every game of Catan begins with a
                            randomly generated board, there's some value in implementing it.
                        </p>

                        <p>The randomization process involved creating a function that utilized <code>Math.random</code>
                            to shuffle
                            the styles and then reassign them to the tiles.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h2>ROADS AND SETTLES</h2>
                        <p>Creating the road and settlement grid was just the beginning – they had to be interactive
                            too! During
                            set up in a game of Catan, players first choose a settlement spot and then place a road
                            adjacent to
                            their settlement pointing either up left or right. This meant the roads had to be invisible
                            until a
                            player built their settlement. Once settled, only the three adjacent roads should appear
                            into view.
                        </p>

                    <h2>PROBLEM SOLVING</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Working on this project made me realise just how much work and effort goes into creating
                            seemingly 'simple' games like Catan. It took a lot of problem solving and back tracking to
                            create something even remotely functional.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, once something is invisible, you don't want it clickable anymore. And when you
                            click something, it should stay active. Randomising the board should remove all active
                            settles
                            and roads. The list goes on… in the end, I only really managed to create the first few steps
                            in
                            the game.
                        </p>

                    <h2>FINAL PRODUCT</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Like I mentioned above, this was about the extent of what I was capable of creating within
                            the
                            span of this project, and it's barely scratching the surface of what the full game is like.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sure, it's been a learning curve, and I've picked up quite a bit along the way. But seeing
                            the
                            potential of JavaScript makes me excited to learn more.
