                                    <p>This case study showcases my ability to create a structured, accessible, and
                                        semantic website, alongside responsiveness, animations, and other unique
                                        features, all built with pure HTML, CSS, and bits of JavaScript. With this, I
                                        aim to highlight my understanding of modern semantics, the importance of
                                        inclusivity, and an overall efficient workflow.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Briefing</h3>
                                    <p>For this project, I was tasked with selecting any website with lacking or
                                        downright bad code, re-creating said website from scratch, and improving upon
                                        the code.

                                        I chose to re-create tonik.com, a design agency based in Poland. Unbeknownst to
                                        me, they have since made some changes to the design of their website, so
                                        unfortunately, the present-day comparison won't be as exact.
                                    </p>

                            <h2>STRUCTURE</h2>
                            <p>When creating the initial structure, I start by figuring out the basic elements needed,
                                mainly focusing on how it's looking on mobile format. This approach makes it easier to
                                ensure responsiveness later on.</p>

                            <p>I begin by placing all the relevant metadata for the website in the
                                <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section. After that, I break down the content into sections
                                and subsections, using appropriate tags to maintain a clear and organized structure.

                    <h2>SEMANTICS</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Throughout my time learning code and working on projects, I've always been encouraged to
                            write semantic code. Semantic HTML is about using elements that carry meaningful information
                            about the structure and content of a web page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That means avoiding elements like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> as
                            well as creating unnecessary classes or using deprecated tags. Provided there are better
                            suited alternative solutions.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h2>ACCESSIBILITY</h2>
                        <p>Accessibility standards are increasingly standardized across websites, so I made a conscious
                            effort to prioritize this aspect while writing the code. I employed various methods to
                            enhance the website's accessibility. These include writing semantic code (as mentioned
                            before), providing images with appropriate <code>&lt;alt&gt;</code> tags, establishing a
                            logical focus order,
                            utilizing <code>aria-label</code>'s, ensuring sufficient color contrast throughout, and
                            creating a
                            responsive design.
                        </p>

                    <h2>RESPONSIVENESS</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Responsiveness refers to the ability of a web page to adapt and display effectively across
                            different devices and screen sizes. To achieve this, I utilize both flexbox and CSS grid.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, I implement a <code>@media</code> query at 700 pixels to ensure the design
                            converts
                            seamlessly to a mobile view, resulting in a fully responsive design.
                        </p>

                        <p>A crucial aspect of bringing a website to life is animation. Therefore, I consider
                            understanding animation to be an essential skill for developers. I apply a lot of animation
                            throughout the page, particularly when hovering over elements. To achieve this effect, I
                            utilize the <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class.
                        </p>

                        <h2>QUIRCKS</h2>
                        <p>With the core HTML and CSS in place, it's time to focus on the finer details. I'd like to
                            take this opportunity to highlight some cool tricks I've learned along the way. In this
                            example, I use the invert filter to change the natively black logo and hamburger icon to
                            white whenever the menu is opened.
