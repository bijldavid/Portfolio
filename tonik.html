                                    <p>This case study showcases my ability to create a structured, accessible and
                                        semantic website. Along with responsiveness, animations and other quirks, all
                                        built with pure html, css and bits of java script here and there.

                                        With this, I hope to highlight my understanding of modern semantics, importance
                                        of inclusivity and overall efficient workflow.

                                    <h3>Briefing</h3>
                                    <p>For this project I was tasked to select any website with lacking or downright bad
                                        code. Re-create said website from scratch and improve upon the code.

                                        I chose to re-create tonik.com, a design agency based in Poland. Unbeknownst to
                                        me they have since changed the design of their website a little so,
                                        unfortunately the present day comparison won't be as exact.
                                    </p>

                        <div>
                            <h2>STRUCTURE</h2>
                            <p>When creating the initial structure I start by figuring out the basic elements needed,
                                mainly focusing on how it looks on mobile. Using this approach makes it easier to make
                                the page responsive later on.</p>

                            <p>I begin by putting all the relevant meta data for the website in the
                                <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. After that, I
                                break down the content into sections and subsections using the appropriate tags for a
                                clear and organized structure.

                    <h2>SEMANTICS</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Throughout my time learning code and working on projects, I've always been encouraged to
                            write semantic code. Semantic HTML is about using elements that carry meaningful information
                            about the structure and content of a web page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That means avoiding elements like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> as
                            well as creating unnecessary classes or using deprecated tags. Provided there are better
                            suited alternative solutions.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h2>ACCESSIBILITY</h2>
                        <p>Accessibility is becoming more standardised across websites, so I made a conscious effort to
                            prioritise this aspect while writing the code. I used various methods to improve the
                            website's accessibility. This includes, writing semantic code (as mentioned before),
                            providing images with appropriate <code>&lt;alt&gt;</code> tags, creating a logical focus
                            order, utilising <code>aria-label</code>'s, enforcing sufficient color contrast throughout,
                            and creating a responsive
                            design.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>RESPONSIVENESS</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Responsiveness is the ability of a web page to adapt and display effectively across a
                            variety of devices and screen sizes. For this, I utilise both flexbox and CSS grid.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That, combined with a <code>@media</code> query at 700 pixels to convert the design to a mobile view makes
                            for a completely responsive design.
                        </p>

                        <h2>ANIMATION</h2>
                        <p>A key part of what makes a website come to life is animation. That's why I believe
                            understanding animation is an essential skill to have as a developer. A lot of animation
                            throughout the page is applied when hovering over an element. To do this, I use the
                            <code>:hover</code>
                            pseudo-class.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <video muted="muted" autoplay="autoplay" loop playsinline>

                        <h2>QUIRCKS</h2>
                        <p>Having the core HTML and CSS all in place, it's time to work on the finer details. I'd like
                            to take this time to highlight some cool tricks I learned along the way. In this example I
                            use the invert filter to change the natively black logo and hamburger-icon to white whenever
                            the menu is being opened.
